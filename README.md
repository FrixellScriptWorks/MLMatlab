# MLMatlab
Repository for my Matlab machine learning projects.

Simple, finished, unfinished, scattered, or even cancelled machine learning projects built by me with Matlab. My purpose is to sharpen my skill with machine learning, and also help in solving modern problems with it.

My version of Matlab is **Matlab 2015b**. Yes, the confusion matrix for predicting projects is manual so hopefully still informatics. This is because confusion matrix is implemented in Matlab 2018 or later.

Here are my project(s):
## Iris Classification with Linear Discriminant Analysis
