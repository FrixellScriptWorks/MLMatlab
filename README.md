# Machine Learning Projects
Repository for my machine learning projects.

Simple, finished, unfinished, scattered, or even cancelled machine learning projects built by me with all tools. My purpose is to sharpen my skill with machine learning, and also help in solving modern problems with it. Thus, providing me with plentiful of portofolio projects.

Currently, I'm only using Jupyter and Matlab as tools for this projects as I am familiar with Python and Matlab environment from my college.

My version of Matlab is **Matlab 2015b**. Yes, the confusion matrix for predicting projects is available only in array mode and I make a manual figure so hopefully still informatics. This is because confusion matrix figure is implemented in Matlab 2018 or later.

My version of Jupyter is 5.7.8 and Sklearn 0.20.3
This version is clear as I made the project, expect to get an upgrade if something happens.

Here are my project(s):
## Iris Classification with Linear Discriminant Analysis (Matlab)
> Classic, but this is where the starting step happens. Like the 'Hello World!' program.
> - Myself.

## Isotope Classification with Decision Tree (Jupyter)
> Classifying isotope from radioactive source along with validation and test with decision tree classifier. Isotope used are Co60, Na22, Am241, Cs137, Sr90. Processing time also recorded and dependant of my device. Specification added in the link's readme.
